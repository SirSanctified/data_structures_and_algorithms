# data_structures_and_algorithms
This repository contains code for data structures and algorithms from my DSA module.
 Some, if not most of this code is not perfect in terms of time and space complexity;
 Help is appreciated, I want to understand this topic better I hope the correctness 
 of the information contained in this repository will be of great help to anyone who would like to learn
 this topic, so I thought if I publish my codes on this platform they will be reviewed by experts and get more insights.
 Publishing this is a way of making my self responsible and my contribution to the open source world.

Data Structures

Hash Table: This is a type of data structure where data is stored in (key, value) form. Accessing an item is done in O(1)
time, but after handling collision with separate chaining and with linear probing, the time complexity becomes O(n) 
in the worst case.

Stack: Stack data structure is a last in first out (LIFO) data structure where an item that gets on to the stack last 
ist the one to get out first. The worst case time complexity of the stack is in O(1).

Queue: Queue is a first in first out (FIFO) data structure. It has the worst case time complexity of O(1) since insertion 
is always done at the end of the queue while deletion is at the start of the queue. No traversal is needed. However, the priority
queue has the worst case time complexity of O(n) for insertions and O(1) for deletions
